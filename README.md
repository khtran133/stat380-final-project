# Analyzing the Relationship Between Poverty and Crime

*By Dominic Klonicki and Khoi Tran*

## Overview

Our final project uses data of poverty throughout the United States on a per-county basis, and attempts to establish a relationship between poverty and crime rates. Most importantly, it attempts to establish a relationship between inequality in poverty, as defined by variance in poverty statistics per county (within the same state), and crime rates.
